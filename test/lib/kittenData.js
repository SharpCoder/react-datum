    "description": "Alley Cat Project does Trap/Neuter/Release of feral cats in Seattle to help decrease the population of homeless cats and kittens. We sometimes come across young kittens who need to be fostered until they are up to weight for spay/neuter and adoption (2 lbs.=about 2 months). Some may be \"bottle babies\" some may be young, but semi-feral, needing socialization; Are you experienced with this, or willing to be trained?\n\nNote: The kittens in this photos have already been fostered in an ACP homes. They are NOT currently available for adoption.\n\nACP also often has a particular need for foster parents for semi-feral juvenile or young adult cats. This may require patience and technique to work with the cat to gain their trust and teach them to appreciate human contact, so that they can be eventually adopted as pets. Anyone with experience bottle feeding homeless newborn kittens will also be appreciated.\n\nPlease call Deborah if you are interested in helping: (206)234-7739  Thank you!",

If litter box issues arise, call a vet ASAP to rule out anything medical; most issues are easily resolved with a few small adjustments. Cat claws can be carefully trimmed as needed, but we discourage declawing because it can cause serious health and behavioral issues. Familiarity with common household hazards can go a long way in keeping cats safe. Statistically, indoor cats live longer than outdoor cats and tend to have less medical expenses. Some cats would enjoy having safe access to the outdoors, either on a leash and harness, with supervision, or in an enclosed area - however, many cats can live happily and successfully as indoor only pets.\n \nTo reduce the chance of boredom and depression, cats should have a stimulating environment. Cats enjoy cozy places to relax and look out windows, high perches for surveying, a sturdy scratching post (appropriate places to scratch are a must), boxes or beds to hide in so they feel safe, catnip, cat grass, food puzzles, and toys. Cats also need daily exercise with interactive playtime. Tiring them out before bed (with a snack to follow) can help ensure everyone gets a better nightâs sleep. \n \nNewly adopted cats will need time to adjust to their surroundings. Patience and compassion will help ease the transition. With good care and lots of love, cats can live 15 or more years. \n \nMore info: \n \nCat Care Basics (courtesy HSUS): http://www.animalsheltering.org/resources/sample/cat-samples/hsus-cat-care-basics.pdf\n\nLitter Box Issues: http://www.paws.org/library/cats/behavior/litter-box-solving-problems/\n \nHousehold Dangers: Http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/resources/tips/common_household_dangers_pets.html\n\nBefore You Adopt: http://www.seattle.gov/animal-shelter/adopt/befo",

    "description": "**Important Note** You won't find this kitty at the shelter. This kitty is waiting patiently in foster care for your call. Please contact the Foster Care Hotline at 206-684-0685 to arrange a meeting. Thank you! Rob Roy is a sweet young, energetic boy who loves to run and play. If you throw a treasured toy across the room he will gladly chase after it and then entertain you with some one-cat soccer. He loves to climb and explore or dart across the tile floor and slide under the sofa to retrieve a lost toy. Have dust bunnies in hard to reach places? Rob Roy will gladly find them for you and pull them out into the open! Favorite toys include the laser, shadows, and a small soft ball filled with catnip. Though timid at first and hesitant to be pet, Rob Roy enjoys human companionship and especially likes to follow you around the house and observe all you do. He is particularly attuned to meal times , eager to remind you when it's time to be fed. Rob Roy is not a clingy cat but once he feels comfortable, will happily snuggle at your feet as you're waking up in the morning! Rob Roy adores other cats and would find himself quite lonely without a patient older brother or sister to play with and continue his studies in all things feline. He would do best in a somewhat quite home with both people and cats willing to play with him. Older kids, or patient younger children, should be OK. Rob Roy has been treated for a gastrointestinal condition in the past and needs a guardian who can commit to always feeding him a particular grain-free diet to keep him healthy. This food is easily found at local pet stores or vet offices [or possibly on line where it might be cheaper?]. In return for this minimal care, he will make a handsome, healthy, and entertaining companion.",

As a kitten, she lost vision as a kitten due to glaucoma so the vet team removed her eyes to make her more comfortable. And is she ever! Ashley is super affectionate and loving but is a true kitten in every sense of the word. She gets along well with the dog in her foster home and she'd probably like to have animal friends to keep her company. Ashley will need to be an indoor-only cat because she's blind. However, having a blind cat isn't very different from having any other cat. Blind cats often do best when furniture isn't rearranged frequently. Ashley is a playful and sweet girl excited and ready to meet her new family! Ashley is staying in a foster home while she waits for her new family. If you'd like to meet her, please contact our adoption team at 425.649.7563 or adoption@seattlehumane.org! Ashley is spayed, microchipped and vaccinated.

She is current on her vaccines and tested negative for Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). She has been wormed and flea treated.\n\nHistory: Jorie comes from another local rescue. PUP was asked to help and we are so glad we did. \n\nNotes from Jorie's Foster Home:\n\nLittle Jorie is the sweetest and the most feminine little kitty I've met.She is fairly reserved as in a little shy if her surroundings become too busy; she prefers to observe from the sidelines, if at all.  She is not into racing and chasing....it's as though she regards it as \"unladylike\".   Jorie does love her cat tree; climbing high to watch the birds, napping or an occasional tango with a hanging toy.\n\nIn the evenings, when the fur kids are quietly hanging out, watching TV or sleeping, Jorie comes along and joins pups and kitties alike, in my lap so she can gather up her fair share of love!!!  She is VERY affectionate.  She will climb on you like a cat tree....back of the chair behind your head, on your head, your shoulders...all while purring quite loudly, to the tune of some dance routine only she can see or hear.\n\nDuring the day when she's not sleeping on the basket of laundry, I'm most apt to find her sleeping upstairs on my bed.  Jorie's favorite friend is my older cat, Tomas.  Tomas is my 15 lb. retired farm cat and mouser who is also not interested in the teenage play of \"catch me if you can\", racing up and down the stairs.  I often see him lazing about on the bed washing Jorie's face.\n\nJorie is one who would shine her brightest as an only kitten with an adult kitty friend or maybe a teenage friend that is also happier living the mellower life, much like herself.  I believe Jorie would love playing as long as her mate was not as rambunctious as her current housemates!  She would also feel very blessed if her new home included a nice, high kitty tree.  :) \n\n{ Note: The above description reflects the behavior we have observed in the cat's foster home.

Pipin is especially friend when he knows you're otherwise engaged...and will quickly want up on your lap...then down...then up...and so on. \n\nPipin has not been around any children but he has been around my caged birds.

    "description": "DOB 6/22/15 Mocha (the black kitty) is very curious and social. Hi foster home writes: He still hides at first, but comes out shortly after. He almost scratched my doorknob off in my bathroom and was meowing so loud at night that I would bring him into my bedroom at night. I would wake up to him curled up on my bed and each day he got closer and now snuggles right beside me. He is extremely curious and loves to watch/follow my other cat and really loves chasing toys around (preferably balls that roll and jingle). His purr is one of the loudest I've heard and you don't have to be petting him to hear it. He starts to purr as soon as he is in the presence of people/kitties. He also loves food and comes running each time I feed him, and loves dried salmon treats. He should be adopted with his sister, Toffee.We are open for adoptions Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday from 12-7. \nIf the cat in in a foster home, we are happy to arrange an appointment.

Her foster home writes: She finds a cozy spot to curl up in for the day and seems to be her happiest when she can peacefully sleep and curl up with her brother. I do hear her chasing around toys at night, but she is definitely the calm one during the day. She still hisses when I approach her at first, but she starts purring instantly when you brush her.We are open for adoptions Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday from 12-7. \nIf the cat in in a foster home, we are happy to arrange an appointment.

They are always exploring, playing, cuddling, and practically purr just thinking someone might come into the room.  Their mother was seen jumping out of a trailer that was being moved from one junk yard to another.  At the new location, two tiny kittens were found hiding under the trash.  These girls were instantly happy with whatever life had given them despite the sad beginnings.  Now they are looking and waiting for a great home to appreciate all the love they have to give!  Micah and Kelby are not Cat Tales cats but are being posted as a courtesy for another rescuer. \nIf you would like to meet Micah and Kelby please email fortheloveofcush@gmail.com.\nUpdate from their foster mom, straight from the girls' mouths....\n\nHi! How are you doing?! We know it's not really the right forum in which to ask, but we're just such polite girls that we couldn't resist, and we absolutely love making new friends! You should also probably know that we'v  been told that we're the best kind of friends to have because we can make anyone smile (no matter what kind of day they've had) with our infectiously happy and enthusiastic personalities and affinities for snuggles.  We can liven up even the most boring tasks with our always interested presence and selfless offers of assistance, and we pretty much radiate sunshine with our gentle but loud purrs, prances with tails raised, and soft head bonks. So, if you're looking for two new best friends who were born with the ability to make every one of your days better just by being ourselves, our foster family is pretty sure the slogan \"who rescued who?\" was written with us in mind!  Please email fortheloveofcush@gmail.com to find out more about us!\n\nP.S. We're about 7-months-old, spayed, vaccinated, FIV/FeLV tested, microchipped, and litterbox trained!",

    "description": "Artemis is a bit on the shy side but is a sweet girl once she knows you. Her mom was found pregnant at a state park. She was ready to have her babies, and she did just the next day! A nice volunteer was the one who found her and after much effort to find her family it was evident that this family would benefit from being at Purrfect Pals. The Greek Mythology fosters spent time in a wonderful foster home and are now looking forward to finding their forever homes. Artemis a typical, sweet, bouncy kitten. The thing that's not typical about her is that her initial FIV test came back positive. MOST LIKELY that means she received antibodies from his FIV+ mother while nursing and she may not actually have FIV. The only way to know for certain is to test Artemis again when she is 6 months old. If she tests positive then, she would be diagnosed as FIV positive. She may also test negative at that point and be considered free of the disease, with the early positive being attributed to the antibodies he received from her mom. For now, Artemis needs a home with no other cats or with one of her siblings. Once her FIV status is clarified, she can have a feline brother or sister with the same FIV status. Artemis's adopter can schedule an appointment at our Purrfect clinic in Arlington to have her retested for FIV (at no-charge) when she is 6 months old. If Artemis is actually FIV+, the adopter would have the option to make her a permanent foster cat. Being a permanent foster means Purrfect Pals would provide life-long coverage for any of Artemis's medical needs related to FIV at our vet in Smoky Point. It is important to note that FIV+ cats can live normal lifespans and that the virus is not a concern for people or pets other than cats.

    "description": "Many questions can be answered by reading through the text below. Kindly read the information before contacting us. Please note: The picture above is a stock photo.\nThank you for your interest in foster kittens! \nKittens who are in our foster care program are generally kittens who arrived at the humane society as unweaned orphans , were still nursing, or were not old or big enough to be placed up for adoption. These kittens would not have survived in a stressful shelter environment. Our foster care program provides care and comfort for animals with special needs in private homes of our trained volunteer foster care providers. \nOnce the kittens are old enough (usually 6-8 weeks) and weigh enough to be spayed or neutered (2 lbs), they return to the shelter for adoption. Call the shelter at (360) 733-2080 to inquire about available kittens. \nPlease note that we do not place âholdsâ on animals until youâve met them in person, even if youâve filled out an application and expressed interest in a specific animal. This is because we want to ensure that each animal is a good fit for the interested party, and that the interested party is a good fit for the animal. We try to set each adoption up for success, for both the animals and for the people.  \nThe kittens would love to meet you! Do you feel the same? Please fill out an adoption application (here or at either shelter) and turn it in to Emily Wyss the foster care coordinator via email at foster@whatcomhumane.org, or fax it to 360.733.4746. Our adoption counselors will help you figure out if you're right for each other.\n\nQuestions about foster kittens in general or other foster animals?

They are very people oriented with little fear of any other animals or loud noises, because of this, they must be INDOOR only cats. Due to lack of fear, they wouldn't survive a single day outside. They have been raised in a home without children, so they will only be placed in a home with children age 6 and older.\nBilly is a very active kitten, who will find you when he's done playing and curl up on your chest for a nap.

    "description": "This is Sarah, born the end of May, 2015. She was part of a litter of 5, that we rescued after their feral mom abandoned them in a barn at approximately 4 weeks old. We've kept them a little longer than normal because they had some parasite issues to resolve, but they are 100% healthy now, spayed/neutered and ready for new homes. Sarah would love to be adopted with her brother Billy, but would be okay to go by herself also. These kittens were taken into a busy home at a very young age. They are very people oriented with little fear of any other animals or loud noises, because of this, they must be INDOOR only cats. Due to lack of fear, they wouldn't survive a single day outside. They have been raised in a home without children, so they will only be placed in a home with children age 6 and older.\nSarah is a very active kitten, who will find you when she's played herself tired and wants to nap next to you on the couch. Her favorite thing to do is wrap herself around your leg as you walk by, but no claws or teeth involved, just soft kitty feet.\nAdopters must complete an adoption application and pay an adoption fee of $150",

Sheldon is a bit playful but would rather cuddle, and it will take him a bit longer to warm up to someone new. But as long as his brother is by his side he is fine. I can't keep them out of water. They love the water and Leonard will actually try to jump in the tub with you. Sheldon is a talker who lives up to his name and is always complaining. They were named after characters in the show the Big Bang Theory. Sheldon has shorter hair and is lighter colored. \n\nThey are good with other cats.

    "description": "Stevie is a lovely male kitten who is blind. We are guessing his birthdate is in the first week of August 2015. He was born into a feral colony on a farm, and was one of a litter of five, all of his siblings being orange tabbies. Stevie is a long-haired cat, and although his coat started as solid black, it has been developing a very distinctive black smoke colour. Stevie has been neutered and vaccinated.\n\nStevie had his eyes removed when he was nearly three months old as a result of a combination of glaucoma and infection. Other than the eyes, he has been very healthy. His personality is amazing. He is both fun and funny, and outgoing. Although he had to be in screaming pain for most of his life, he never stopped purring and playing. After his eye surgery, he came out of the anaesthetic and immediately started to play with the vet techs. \n\nStevie loves to explore on his own and does not need anyone to move him to a new space - he can find his way just fine. He jumps and plays just like a cat who can see. Until he knows the distance, he backs down off the couch or chair, but when he figures out the distance he will just jump. A paper bag is a great adventure for him (see video), and he loves to play with his ball as well. Stevieâs littermate, who is also up for adoption, is a good buddy to him, if anyone would be interested in the pair together.\n\nStevie will be able to lead an almost completely normal life, but he will need to be strictly indoor-only. He will need a fairly static environment - a home without clutter and that has furniture and things that are not moved around a lot. He will learn every inch of his new home and then will never bump into anything -- if nothing moves. He gets along well with the other kittens, cats, and dogs in his foster home. It would be nice if he could have an animal friend to enrich his life in his adoptive home, but we don't want his adoptive home to have very playful dogs or aggressive cats because of Stevie's obvious disadvantage. A suitable adoptive home will not have family members younger than teenagers. \n\nIt would be best if he could go to someone with experience with blind cats, but a motivated person could certainly learn how to care for him. His adoption will be subject to a $225 fee and a home visit. Please contact us at mbruce8@shaw.ca if you are interested in Stevie and tell us about yourself and the life you envision for him. \n\nYou can view a video of Stevie at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx3fubTdr2Q",

    "description": "*** Please note that the kittens in the photos are from previous years.  Please contact us to find out if we currently have any kittens available.  ***\n\nWhen we have kittens, our kittens don't live at the shelter. They're in foster homes and will be ready for adoption once they're weaned.  If you are interested, please complete the standard pre-adopt form on our web site. We can arrange for you to meet the babies so you can pick out your new family member.\n\nThe kittens will need to go to homes where they will have a cat friend to keep them company, to play with them and snooze with them while you're busy. It doesn't necessarily have to be another kitten (though that's ideal), as long as they will have a young feline friend. These are social critters who rely on games with feline pals to learn life skills. Those who grow up without feline company tend to lose the ability to relate to other cats and have a harder time adjusting to the presence of other cats later in life. They can also become overly dependent on you. We also ask that our kittens go to indoor homes for safety from traffic, predators, disease, poisons, and other dangers in the outside world.\n\nHaving a kitten is like having a toddler in the house. They'll get into everything and they can keep you up at night by scampering around or pouncing your moving toes under the blankets. You'll need patience and you'll need to kitten-proof your house. Cover the soil of your potted plants, hide delicate ornaments and jewelry, tie back your sheer drapes, keep the toilet lid down and check the washer and dryer before you turn them on. After a year or so, your rambunctious little monster will settle down and become a dignified, inscrutable feline who is content to spend long periods meditating and napping. He or she will need you for the next 15 to 20 years of a cat's life span. So consider where you might be 15 or 20 years from now and be sure your cat can still be with you.

Baby Beans doesnât careâ¦ he frolics and plays like any other kitten. However, his case is extreme and he is also bowel and bladder incontinent.\n\nThis incontinence caused his people to bring him to be euthanized. The vet just could not euthanize a roly, poly, playful, purring baby (we are so very fortunate to work with so many kind, compassionate vets) so they asked us if we could help. Incontinent animals are a challenge from a practical perspective, and Beans will also need to be closely monitored as he will be susceptible to infections.\n\nWe donât know how long he will be with us, but he is here now.

Of course he does, heâs really just a kitten. \n\nMr. Green has an old eye injury but it does not seem to affect him at all.  The white on the eye is the scar from the injury.  Mr. Green came to us from another shelter and we donât have too much information on his past.  However we have been informed that he loves other felines and canines.  We figure Mr. Green will do best in a home where he has feline and/or canine companions to play with. \n\nMr. Green is a sweet kid who like attention and snuggles.

    "description": "I am a black and white tuxedo named Tux. I am a very handsome gentleman. I started life out a little rough, due to my owner dying.  I lived in an outer building on some property with several other cats and my siblings. After my owner died, his daughter did her best to care for me. I became skittish of people and not sure I could trust them, as I wasn't around people that much. After arriving at my foster moms, she gave me chill time and to learn that people could be trusted and wanted what's best for me. It only took a few days and I began to come around, starting by purring, then rubbing up against my foster moms legs, then letting her pet me and pick me up. I am still a little unsure, but definitely learning to love my foster mom. I love to be petted and purr, and definitely love meal time. I am a good eater, and enjoy canned food, preferably the ones that have gravy, twice a day and have access to dry food that I love to snack on. I will take a little patience getting use to a new forever home, and small children will take me awhile to adjust too. I have been microchipped.   I am an indoor only cat and would love for you to come have a visit with me. If you would love that also, please fill out an application. i was born in April and tested negative for feline leukemia and FIV.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an adoption application on our website at sccpets.com.",

They never scratch or bite. They may hiss when they first get to their new home, but I really doubt it. They have never had an accident once, they use their litter box neatly and diligently, they don't get into anything they shouldn't, and they don't scratch the furniture. Even if I accidentally leave their treats out (which they love), they will be exactly where I left them, untouched.\n\nThese gorgeous girls LOVE to PLAY, and I have found it is the best way to engage and bond with them. They play on their own a bit too but especially like when I play with them. It's very sweet to see how aware these two are of each other and how they each let the other have their turn to play back and forth. It is very important that these two girls go to a home where someone will play with them every day. \n\nShay is starting to come around more, and clearly likes to be 'near the action' as long as it doesn't get to close. When she is in the mood-you'll be able to tell when she is very relaxed- she will let you scratch her under her chin and behind the ears and she obviously enjoys it, but can only handle so much. Once in a while she also lets you hold her. She will definitively get better and better as she gets more trusting, and I am sure she is going to be a love bug one day.\n\nTaya and Shay are bonded and must be adopted together.",

    "description": "This handsome fellow has an appetite for adventure. His behavior is normal for a kitten; it's his amazing energy that makes this little boy stand out. He would probably be too much to integrate in with an existing older cat, but would do well with a kitten about his age who won't be upset by his rocket-propelled fun. He would do best in a home without small children. He will need you to set some boundaries in his new home. Kittens need to hone their instinctual skills during their early development. Outdoor action activities such as: hunting birds and climbing trees can translate easily to much safer indoor games such as: chasing toys, climbing an indoor cat tree, attacking a stationary scratching post and jumping out of a cardboard box. Planning ahead by creating a safe, yet thrilling indoor environment for him will make a huge difference for both of you. If you want to see what warp-speed enthusiasm really looks like, this cutie is ready to be your partner in adventure.

    "description": "Peaches & Blackberry are both Spayed, Up To Date on Shots and Microchipped. Peaches Gray/White while Blackberry is Black.\nThey are siblings who love each other very much. They were found together as tiny kittens living outside on their own. Luckily a nice woman scooped them up and took them in so they could have a chance at becoming part of someone's family.They are both sweet girls with beautiful loud purrs. Blackberry is the bolder of the two, seeking out attention and affection from her foster family while Peaches can be a bit more shy. While Peaches might be the shyer one she will reward you with snuggles and purrs once she feels safe in your lap. They love kids and do well with other cats. The have not been exposed to dogs yet. These two will be a wonderful addition to a family looking for sweetest kitties to snuggle up with.\nIf interested in meeting Blackberry and Peaches please contact Kelly at 503-810-8749 or khardin28@lycos.com",

This might be a spare bedroom or even a good size bathroom.\n\n\nTo learn more, contact our Volunteer Program Assistant, Nancy Puro at 503-925-8803 or via email at nancyp@catadoptionteam.org.\n\n\nThank you for helping us save lives!\n\n\n*NOTE: The kittens pictured are all in their loving forever homes!

    "description": "Are you an Introvert? Because I am and I need someone who understands me. Oh, I'm not shy! Once I get to know you, I am the most playful, mischievous and loving kitten. But I'm not one to put on a big show for total strangers, so I can't compete with other kittens that rush over to you right away. If you'll just take some time and understand my world, you might find that I am perfect kitty match for you.I live with three grown cats in my foster home, and I like them just fine. I'm not great with loud noises, so I'm a little scared of big men and loud kids. I am lovey and like your attention, but I'm not needy, so I can handle it if you are away during the day as long as you give me love and play time when you get home. Gidget can be viewed in her foster home in the NW Portland/Cedar Mill area.

The mom abandoned her when she was just old enough to be weaned and it was noticed then that she had infection in both her eyes. She was one of the lucky ones in that the infection had mostly healed on its own. Unfortunately, she still suffered damage to both her eyes. Because she has limited vision, she's very skittish, and because of this will need to go to a home with no small children.

She was a scared 6 week old kitten who showed up on the porch of one of our rescuers. She is hilariously spunky and loves to play. Since coming in to foster care she has bonded with another cat in her home. Fawn is 2 yrs old and was rescued from a feral mom as a kitten. Though she lives with other cats she has never had a close companion. This may be because of her quiet, gentle nature. Amazingly, she and Liberty Belle have become like kitten sisters. They wrestle and play constantly and sleep together. Because of this close relationship their foster mom would like to find them a home together. An adult home would be best and both will need to be indoor only. A sweeter pair you will not find.

I really want a family that will take the time to play with me and teach me the rules of the house. I am an INDOOR ONLY kitty, so please do not adopt me if you think you will put me outside, it is too dangerous out there with bad people, cars and animals that may hurt me. I also have a few things I want to teach you about me.

He is very shy at first and is likely to find a safe place to hide, but will come out for treats and sometimes to play. He's more social than his sister, and is quicker to let you approach him, he tries to communicate with you by meowing, and once you gain his trust he'll slowly start coming to you for attention.We are offering reduced pricing to the right home for Squeak.

They were then fostered in an effort to socialize them, as they were feral and didn't have any human contact. Tilly is currently back in foster with her brother who she is really bonded with. She is full of energy and loves to play and hunt bugs she finds in the house, she will happily play with anything, and it is a great way to bond with her. She is still very shy, and is unsure about being touched or held, and will only let you pet her when she's up to it, usually when she's sleepy, but when she does get attention she loves it. Tilly would be best suited to a quite home, where she can slowly adjust to her surrendering and new family at her own pace. We are offering reduced pricing to the right home for Tilly. Please come to the Trail Regional BCSPCA and meet this little guy or contact us at 250-368-5910 or trail@spca.bc.ca Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 1.99 Age: 0yrs 5mths 1wks",

My favorite activities are chasing my brother Smokey and my favorite toys are little balls and wands with feathers. Smokey and I are here together at Greenhill, hoping that our adoption into new homes will happen very soon. We were found as tiny stray kittens in the Cottage Grove area, and were taken to the shelter there and then transferred to Greenhill. Because we were so young we were placed in a foster home for about two months of growing-up time. During my time there I had lots of fun chasing my brother, playing with toys, napping in a kitten bed and gazing out the window. I also learned all about using a scratching post and litter box and met lots of new people. My foster parent said I'm \"very cuddly when tired, but also very energetic and playful when awake.\" If you're thinking about adopting a new kitten then you better hurry out to Greenhill right away because I probably won't be here very long!

We were all surrendered for adoption by the person who had cared for us and our mother for the last three months. She was moving and couldn't care for all of us where she was going to be living in the future. She described me as active, affectionate, friendly to everyone, bold, daring and fearless. I enjoyed sleeping with my mom and siblings, chasing after toys, climbing, jumping, wrestling and just hanging out. I'm hoping to find a nice home with a safe back yard in a quiet neighborhood with owners who will love me forever. I'd be a great addition to anyone's pet family so what are you waiting for?

    "description": "Hello ladies and gentlemen,\nAllow me to introduce myself. \nI am a Siamese one year old female. My name is Zuri. It means beautiful in Africa. Which you can see, fits me perfectly. My foster mother says I am the most beautiful feline she has ever seen! I am soft, super sweet and loving too. With a playful side. I have a long coat which sheds a bit so hair balls might become an issue when I groom myself, but so far it hasn't. \nI like to sit with my human and enjoy gentle loves and pets. Naps of course is my favorite activity most of the day. I am not too finicky about my food and I don't bite, scratch, or fight which means that any other animals or humans in the home have to be respectful of me other wise they might hurt me when I don't fight back. \nI absolutly love sitting in a window and watching the birds and squirrels. I love it so much that I chatter at them and want to run outside any chance I get and chase them! I am so fast and silent that my foster mom gets scared when she can't find me. A little kitty trick I play on her every once in awhile, haha. My foster mom won't let me outside because she says it is the rescues rules and I might get lost or hit by a car outside, or since I am so beautiful, someone might catnap me. She takes really good care of me to ensure I am safe and happy! I love wet food, but it is starting to make my trim waist line get a little plump, so I can only have it for a treat or a tiny bit each day. My foster mom leaves fresh dry food and water out for me all day. I love a nice warm and soft place to sleep. The back of the couch or her bed is great, but the dogs chase me. \nI like to play too! I have this one toy which my foster mom bought for me and it's so cool! It only cost $1 at the pet store and entertains me for quite awhile. Sometimes I lose it which can be frustrating for me but my foster mom always finds it and she said she will let me take it with me to my new family home!! \nWell that is alot of information about me so I really hope the right family finds me and adopts me forever! My foster mom sure does love me but she wants me to be in a permanent home of my own for the rest of my life which will be a long time since I am only one years old. I would love to meet my family soon. Wouldn't that be a superb Christmas gift for me?!\nThank you for reading my long bio. I just wanted you to know everything about me so you can make the best decission for your family and me!\n\nSincerely,\nZuri the beautiful\n\nPlease contact us for more details 541-782-THOR (8467) or fill out our application on our website under adoption application at www.theheartofrescue.com.",

    "description": "Found along the side of Hwy 220, my littermates scattered when the car stopped to try and gather us.  I lagged behind a big, the smaller of them, so I was captured, and not very happy about it either.  No one else was found.  I was then taken to the shelter, but was sooooo tiny, at about 2 weeks of age.  I hissed and spat big time, so they gave me space.  Still being bottle fed, but not thriving very well, I was put in the pen with the four other kittens that had also just arrived.  One of the 3 week old kittens, Fionna, immediately began cleaning my face and ears and acting all motherly to me.  That comforted me a lot.  I camped out with them, and when I finally decided I could be a kitty, they noticed a strangeness to my gait.  Off to the vet I went, and the x-rays revealed that I have a fractured femur that was already beginning to calcify around the break.  At this point, I could have it re-broken and pinned, or let it heal as is, as us kitties are great healers.  We all opted on the latter.  So, I rest more that the others, am given extra formula for more calcium consumption, but may always walk crickled.  Have learned to purr and enjoy me tummy rubs.

She has blossomed with proper care. Very friendly.\n\nShe's been wormed twice now and has had her first vaccination.\n\nShe's beautifully marked, a tabby calico, very people oriented, very talkative and loves to be held.\n\nFamily must have a history of cats living (indoor) long lives with them with great care and quality food. MUST NOT DECLAW. She will be spayed at approximately 5-6 months, will receive her booster shot and rabies.\n\nAlso note: It looks like Lindy's tail has been broken. If it isn't healed by the time she is spayed, we'll have to have 3 of 4 inches of her tail amputated unfortunately. She had a tough life before she was brought to FTLOP...poor thing.\n\nAdoption fee $100 to cover vet expenses.\n\nWill also microchip her too.",

    "description": "This handsome fellow has an appetite for adventure. His behavior is normal for a kitten; it's his amazing energy that makes this little boy stand out. He would probably be too much to integrate in with an existing older cat, but would do well with a kitten about his age who won't be upset by his rocket-propelled fun. He would do best in a home without small children. He will need you to set some boundaries in his new home. Kittens need to hone their instinctual skills during their early development. Outdoor action activities such as: hunting birds and climbing trees can translate easily to much safer indoor games such as: chasing toys, climbing an indoor cat tree, attacking a stationary scratching post and jumping out of a cardboard box. Planning ahead by creating a safe, yet thrilling indoor environment for him will make a huge difference for both of you. If you want to see what warp-speed enthusiasm really looks like, this cutie is ready to be your partner in adventure.

The need is especially urgent as the weather heats up.\n\n\nCommitment is typically 2-8 weeks and requires a room where the mom and kittens can be separated from other household pets.  This might be a spare bedroom or even a good size bathroom.\n\n\nTo learn more, contact our Volunteer Program Assistant, Nancy Puro at 503-925-8803 or via email at nancyp@catadoptionteam.org.\n\n\nThank you for helping us save lives!\n\n\n*NOTE: The kittens pictured are all in their loving forever homes!

Apple Cider is a very social and friendly kitten who likes to be held when she is not chasing and wrestling with her sister. She has been around her foster's dogs and adult cats and gets along fine with them. Apple Cider is a good eater and has excellent litter box habits. She is spayed and has had all her kitten shots. Like most kittens, she will be happiest in a home with another kitten or active cat or dog to play with. It would be perfect if she could find a forever home with her sister. They have very similar personalities and are a beautiful pair. AC has been in foster care with teenagers, but would probably be fine with younger children. She and her sister would love to join your family for the holidays & beyond.

But I'm not one to put on a big show for total strangers, so I can't compete with other kittens that rush over to you right away. If you'll just take some time and understand my world, you might find that I am perfect kitty match for you.I live with three grown cats in my foster home, and I like them just fine. I'm not great with loud noises, so I'm a little scared of big men and loud kids. I am lovey and like your attention, but I'm not needy, so I can handle it if you are away during the day as long as you give me love and play time when you get home. Gidget can be viewed in her foster home in the NW Portland/Cedar Mill area.

She was a scared 6 week old kitten who showed up on the porch of one of our rescuers. She is hilariously spunky and loves to play. Since coming in to foster care she has bonded with another cat in her home. Fawn is 2 yrs old and was rescued from a feral mom as a kitten. Though she lives with other cats she has never had a close companion. This may be because of her quiet, gentle nature. Amazingly, she and Liberty Belle have become like kitten sisters. They wrestle and play constantly and sleep together. Because of this close relationship their foster mom would like to find them a home together. An adult home would be best and both will need to be indoor only. A sweeter pair you will not find.

I really want a family that will take the time to play with me and teach me the rules of the house. I am an INDOOR ONLY kitty, so please do not adopt me if you think you will put me outside, it is too dangerous out there with bad people, cars and animals that may hurt me. I also have a few things I want to teach you about me.

Now that their rescue, recovery and trust-building is complete, Vito and Virgo are ready for you!\n\nVirgo is the drop-dead gorgeous Lynx Point Siamese, and Vito is the orange tabby.  Vito has the classic orange tabby personality---very easygoing.  Virgo is a little timid and relies on Vito for security.

Who would imagine that such good-looking cats (or any cat) could be discarded like trash? \n\nOnce they were safe with us, we took care of them medically and fattened them up.  Then the staff at their foster home, the Lake Oswego Petco, brought them out of their fearful shells and Vito and Virgo are both snuggly purr machines now! In fact they will start purring loudly even if you just speak to them. Now that their rescue, recovery and trust-building is complete, Vito and Virgo are ready for you!\n\nVito has the classic orange tabby personality---very easygoing.  Virgo is a little timid and relies on Vito for security.  After everything these two experienced together on the street, they are understandably bonded and must be adopted together.\n\nVito and Virgo can be seen at our adoption partner, the Lake Oswego Petco.

This can be discussed more on inquiry. He is up-to-date on shots, and looking for an indoor home. Please contact us if your are interested in Andy.",

She's very quiet and doesn't meow much, she's a silent thinker.  Willow likes calm dogs and had no problems getting along with the other cats. She is good friends with her foster family's young daughter and would do well in a home with quiet, respectful children.\n\n\nWillow's adoption fee is $100 or $150 for two kittens.

During my time there I had lots of fun chasing my brother, playing with toys, napping in a kitten bed and gazing out the window. I also learned all about using a scratching post and litter box and met lots of new people. My foster parent said I'm \"very cuddly when tired, but also very energetic and playful when awake.\" If you're thinking about adopting a new kitten then you better hurry out to Greenhill right away because I probably won't be here very long!

    "description": "Hello ladies and gentlemen,\nAllow me to introduce myself. \nI am a Siamese one year old female. My name is Zuri. It means beautiful in Africa. Which you can see, fits me perfectly. My foster mother says I am the most beautiful feline she has ever seen! I am soft, super sweet and loving too. With a playful side. I have a long coat which sheds a bit so hair balls might become an issue when I groom myself, but so far it hasn't. \nI like to sit with my human and enjoy gentle loves and pets. Naps of course is my favorite activity most of the day. I am not too finicky about my food and I don't bite, scratch, or fight which means that any other animals or humans in the home have to be respectful of me other wise they might hurt me when I don't fight back. \nI absolutly love sitting in a window and watching the birds and squirrels. I love it so much that I chatter at them and want to run outside any chance I get and chase them! I am so fast and silent that my foster mom gets scared when she can't find me. A little kitty trick I play on her every once in awhile, haha. My foster mom won't let me outside because she says it is the rescues rules and I might get lost or hit by a car outside, or since I am so beautiful, someone might catnap me. She takes really good care of me to ensure I am safe and happy! I love wet food, but it is starting to make my trim waist line get a little plump, so I can only have it for a treat or a tiny bit each day. My foster mom leaves fresh dry food and water out for me all day. I love a nice warm and soft place to sleep. The back of the couch or her bed is great, but the dogs chase me. \nI like to play too! I have this one toy which my foster mom bought for me and it's so cool! It only cost $1 at the pet store and entertains me for quite awhile. Sometimes I lose it which can be frustrating for me but my foster mom always finds it and she said she will let me take it with me to my new family home!! \nWell that is alot of information about me so I really hope the right family finds me and adopts me forever! My foster mom sure does love me but she wants me to be in a permanent home of my own for the rest of my life which will be a long time since I am only one years old. I would love to meet my family soon. Wouldn't that be a superb Christmas gift for me?!\nThank you for reading my long bio. I just wanted you to know everything about me so you can make the best decission for your family and me!\n\nSincerely,\nZuri the beautiful\n\nPlease contact us for more details 541-782-THOR (8467) or fill out our application on our website under adoption application at www.theheartofrescue.com.",

Therefore, meets and adoptions take place at either our office or at a place chosen by the foster.   If a pet has 'pending' beside its name, an adoption is imminent. Please fill out an application anyway because adoptions don't always go through. Your application will be kept on file for 30 days in case you find another pet you'd like to apply for.

He is current on his vaccines and tested negative for Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). He has been wormed and flea treated.\n\nHistory: Cooper comes from an overcrowded shelter in California. PUP was asked to help and we are so glad we did. All dogs and cats PUP pulls from California come with health certificates, as required by Washington state.\n\nNotes from Cooper's Foster Home: Cooper is a wonderfully affectionate, fun kitten. He loves to be held, and will climb into your lap to make sure you pet him. He's very playful and will chase string for hours. In his foster home, Cooper has become best friends with the 3 year old cat and plays games with her under the door. He would do well in a house with a playmate - be that human, feline, or canine! He is very good at learning routines and is no fuss about them -- nail clipping, medicine, or even not climbing on certain furniture. Cooper is just a wonderful, loving, easy kitten looking for a fun home!   \n\n{ Note: The above description reflects the behavior we have observed in the cat's foster home. Although PUP provides adopters up to the minute information on our cats, we cannot guarantee they will behave in the same manner in a different environment with new owners. } \n\nAdoption: If you think you have room in your home and heart for this dog and you reside within Washington State, please go to our Adoption Information page.

All dogs and cats PUP pulls from Texas come with health certificates, as required by Washington state.\n\nNotes from Love's Foster Home: Love is a very sweet, loving and curious kitten! He will watch his sister play, trying to learn from her, and enjoys playing with toys (once his sister shows him how it's done!). Love is a little snuggle-bug of an orange kitten who loves spending time with his people and has started exploring the world around him. His personality is growing and he's proving to be a pretty \"chill\" guy, rather than super active. Love is quick with the soft meows when he's missed you, and it is such a cute meow! He is a champ at using the litter box, and tolerates our dogs and isn't the least bit curious about our caged birds. He has won our hearts and will make a lovely companion for his forever family. \n\n{ Note: The above description reflects the behavior we have observed in the cat's foster home. Although PUP provides adopters up to the minute information on our cats, we cannot guarantee they will behave in the same manner in a different environment with new owners. } \n\nAdoption: If you think you have room in your home and heart for this dog and you reside within Washington State, please go to our Adoption Information page.

Unless otherwise requested, any adoption applications we received will be kept on file for future adoption consideration.\n\n* Female Domestic Long Hair/ Maine Coon\n* Approximately 5 months/years old\n* Approximately 4 lbs.\n* Litterbox trained\n* Okay with other cats\n* Okay with dogs\n* Adoption fee: $100\n\nRaising a kitten requires a lot of work and is a commitment! Jorie will be an awesome addition to a family that can give her the attention, exercise, training and affection she deserves.\n\nHealth: Jorie has been spayed and microchipped. She is current on her vaccines and tested negative for Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). She has been wormed and flea treated.\n\nHistory: Jorie comes from another local rescue. PUP was asked to help and we are so glad we did. \n\nNotes from Jorie's Foster Home:\n\nLittle Jorie is the sweetest and the most feminine little kitty I've met.She is fairly reserved as in a little shy if her surroundings become too busy; she prefers to observe from the sidelines, if at all.  She is not into racing and chasing....it's as though she regards it as \"unladylike\".   Jorie does love her cat tree; climbing high to watch the birds, napping or an occasional tango with a hanging toy.\n\nIn the evenings, when the fur kids are quietly hanging out, watching TV or sleeping, Jorie comes along and joins pups and kitties alike, in my lap so she can gather up her fair share of love!!!  She is VERY affectionate.  She will climb on you like a cat tree....back of the chair behind your head, on your head, your shoulders...all while purring quite loudly, to the tune of some dance routine only she can see or hear.\n\nDuring the day when she's not sleeping on the basket of laundry, I'm most apt to find her sleeping upstairs on my bed.  Jorie's favorite friend is my older cat, Tomas.  Tomas is my 15 lb. retired farm cat and mouser who is also not interested in the teenage play of \"catch me if you can\", racing up and down the stairs.  I often see him lazing about on the bed washing Jorie's face.\n\nJorie is one who would shine her brightest as an only kitten with an adult kitty friend or maybe a teenage friend that is also happier living the mellower life, much like herself.  I believe Jorie would love playing as long as her mate was not as rambunctious as her current housemates!  She would also feel very blessed if her new home included a nice, high kitty tree.  :) \n\n{ Note: The above description reflects the behavior we have observed in the cat's foster home.

All dogs and cats PUP pulls from California come with health certificates, as required by Washington state.\n\nNotes from Pipin's Foster Home:\n\nPipin is a little guy for his age but you will soon fall in love with his uniqueness.  From his wide eyed, expressive, huge, orange eyes to his lovely, silky, soft, beige, tiger stripe coat an white bib!!  He is adorable and oh, so affectionate!! \n\nPipin is very playful and tries very hard to keep up with the big boys with all the playing.  He loves talking to you, rubbing on you and climbing on you. He is well litter box trained and gets along well with the dogs as long as they are kitty friendly and not into chasing. \n\nPipin is a little shy when he first meets someone, dog or human; however, his curiosity soon wins out!! Pipin is especially friend when he knows you're otherwise engaged...and will quickly want up on your lap...then down...then up...and so on. \n\nPipin has not been around any children but he has been around my caged birds.  He quickly learned not to walk or sit on the cage tops.  Conures are small parrots that have painful nips!!  So he's pretty much content to just observe.  :-).

If you are interested in meeting her and her\n siblings, please contact her foster mom, Joan, at wolfbird50@comcast.net\n\nCARING FOR CATS:\nIn addition to yearly vet visits, cats require proper nutrition, fresh water, and clean, well-located litter boxes (at least one litter box per cat). If litter box issues arise, call a vet ASAP to rule out anything medical; most issues are easily resolved with a few small adjustments. Cat claws can be carefully trimmed as needed, but we discourage declawing because it can cause serious health and behavioral issues. Familiarity with common household hazards can go a long way in keeping cats safe. Statistically, indoor cats live longer than outdoor cats and tend to have less medical expenses. Some cats would enjoy having safe access to the outdoors, either on a leash and harness, with supervision, or in an enclosed area - however, many cats can live happily and successfully as indoor only pets.\n \nTo reduce the chance of boredom and depression, cats should have a stimulating environment. Cats enjoy cozy places to relax and look out windows, high perches for surveying, a sturdy scratching post (appropriate places to scratch are a must), boxes or beds to hide in so they feel safe, catnip, cat grass, food puzzles, and toys. Cats also need daily exercise with interactive playtime. Tiring them out before bed (with a snack to follow) can help ensure everyone gets a better nightâs sleep. \n \nNewly adopted cats will need time to adjust to their surroundings. Patience and compassion will help ease the transition. With good care and lots of love, cats can live 15 or more years. \n \nMore info: \n \nCat Care Basics (courtesy HSUS): http://www.animalsheltering.org/resources/sample/cat-samples/hsus-cat-care-basics.pdf\n\nLitter Box Issues: http://www.paws.org/library/cats/behavior/litter-box-solving-problems/\n \nHousehold Dangers: Http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/resources/tips/common_household_dangers_pets.html\n\nBefore You Adopt: http://www.seattle.gov/animal-shelter/adopt/befo",

Please contact the Foster Care Hotline at 206-684-0685 to arrange a meeting. Thank you! Rob Roy is a sweet young, energetic boy who loves to run and play. If you throw a treasured toy across the room he will gladly chase after it and then entertain you with some one-cat soccer. He loves to climb and explore or dart across the tile floor and slide under the sofa to retrieve a lost toy. Have dust bunnies in hard to reach places? Rob Roy will gladly find them for you and pull them out into the open! Favorite toys include the laser, shadows, and a small soft ball filled with catnip. Though timid at first and hesitant to be pet, Rob Roy enjoys human companionship and especially likes to follow you around the house and observe all you do. He is particularly attuned to meal times , eager to remind you when it's time to be fed. Rob Roy is not a clingy cat but once he feels comfortable, will happily snuggle at your feet as you're waking up in the morning! Rob Roy adores other cats and would find himself quite lonely without a patient older brother or sister to play with and continue his studies in all things feline. He would do best in a somewhat quite home with both people and cats willing to play with him. Older kids, or patient younger children, should be OK. Rob Roy has been treated for a gastrointestinal condition in the past and needs a guardian who can commit to always feeding him a particular grain-free diet to keep him healthy. This food is easily found at local pet stores or vet offices [or possibly on line where it might be cheaper?]. In return for this minimal care, he will make a handsome, healthy, and entertaining companion.",

Some cats would enjoy having safe access to the outdoors, either on a leash and harness, with supervision, or in an enclosed area - however, many cats can live happily and successfully as indoor only pets.\n \nTo reduce the chance of boredom and depression, cats should have a stimulating environment. Cats enjoy cozy places to relax and look out windows, high perches for surveying, a sturdy scratching post (appropriate places to scratch are a must), boxes or beds to hide in so they feel safe, catnip, cat grass, food puzzles, and toys. Cats also need daily exercise with interactive playtime. Tiring them out before bed (with a snack to follow) can help ensure everyone gets a better nightâs sleep. \n \nNewly adopted cats will need time to adjust to their surroundings. Patience and compassion will help ease the transition. With good care and lots of love, cats can live 15 or more years. \n \nMore info: \n \nCat Care Basics (courtesy HSUS): http://www.animalsheltering.org/resources/sample/cat-samples/hsus-cat-care-basics.pdf\n\nLitter Box Issues: http://www.paws.org/library/cats/behavior/litter-box-solving-problems/\n \nHousehold Dangers: Http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/resources/tips/common_household_dangers_pets.html\n\nBefore You Adopt: http://www.seattle.gov/animal-shelter/adopt/befo",

    "description": "**Important Note** You won't find this kitty at the shelter. This kitty is waiting patiently in foster care for your call. To learn more, please contact their foster parent directly. If, after 24 hours, you have not received a reply, please contact the Foster Care Hotline at 206-684-0685 to arrange a meeting. Thank you! Franny and her two siblings were found outdoors with their mom, and taken to a foster home. At 6 weeks old, they were scared of humans at first but soon became very comfortable in a home environment. Franny, her brother, Figgy, and sister, Felicia, soon learned to use litter boxes, scratching surfaces, and how much fun toys were. Each had some temporary health issues that are common with young kittens but have grown into hardy, active kittens. Franny was a little more resistant to being socialized, as if to say \"I'm tough, you're not fooling me' but soon became a little cuddle bug. She showed her more competitive side when the dangling leather bouncer toy first appeared. Her impulse was to claim it immediately as hers and run with it, not giving her siblings a chance to grab it. Two bouncers were needed, one for her and one for the others. She was also quick to grab both, if given a chance. Her assertiveness was a good match for her bigger brother, Figgy, but she often overpowered her smaller sister, Felicia in fierce wrestling matches. After such normal play for kittens, they usually ended up in a furry pile of bodies for a nap together. They were joined by a slightly older kitten, Jack, and soon welcomed him to their group. They all get along well with the resident adult cats. Whenever neighbors have visited them, there is little sign of any fearfulness and they are soon interacting with other humans. Franny likes to be petted and now frequently prefers to snuggle into a warm lap to take a nap. In mid-November, she and her siblings are confident 3 months old kittens. Franny would easily fit into most households, including one with children. She would enjoy the company of her brother, Figgy, but could easily become friends with a resident cat. She is ready to meet the person or family who would like to offer her a safe, lifetime home. She would be a delightful addition to any household. If you are interested in meeting Franny and her siblings, please contact her foster mom, Joan, at wolfbird50@comcast.net.",

Please contact the Foster Care Hotline at 206-684-0685 to arrange a meeting. Thank you! Butterscotch and Licorice started out life with little human contact but their innate sociable personalities came out within hours of arriving at their foster home. They are playful kittens but sometimes it seems that lap time is more important to them  Butterscotch wants to be constantly near or on his human and Licorice likes nothing better than being upside down on a lap, purring and making air biscuits. While they have similar affectionate personalities, they are physically a study in contrast. Butterscotch may well be the fluffiest orange kitten youve ever seen  who absolutely loves to be brushed - and Licorice has a short coat of dense black fur with a smoky grey undercoat. Together, as they usually are, they are visually stunning. Though they have overcome their rough start in life, they will be a bit shy and skittish in a new environment so will need to start out in a small room and gradually expand their horizons. With the investment of a little patience they will provide a lifetime of lapwarming. Both have impeccable litter box habits.",

    "description": "**Important Note** You won't find this kitty at the shelter. This kitty is waiting patiently in foster care for your call. Please contact the Foster Care Hotline at 206-684-0685 to arrange a meeting. Thank you! My foster mom likes to refer to me as the \"Comeback Kid\". My original sweet nature was temporarily hidden by my fears from being raised outside without human contact. But with time and patient foster parents I have joyfully reclaimed my naturally curious, happy, and playful personality. I have been called \"drop-dead gorgeous\" with my medium length tortie coat and striking markings. Also, I am quite the aerialist when it comes to playtime with my favorite feather toy, then I like to settle into a warm lap for cuddles and brushing. I am very bonded with my sweet, handsome brother, Licorice. Like our names imply, we would like to stick together if at all possible. I also dream of a fairly quiet home so that I can continue to build confidence and learn to trust my adoptive family completely. I am a good eater and have perfect litterbox habits. Are you the one to whom I can devote myself forever? CARING FOR CATS: In addition to yearly vet visits, cats require proper nutrition, fresh water, and clean, well-located litter boxes (at least one litter box per cat). If litter box issues arise, call a vet ASAP to rule out anything medical; most issues are easily resolved with a few small adjustments. Cat claws can be carefully trimmed as needed, but we discourage declawing because it can cause serious health and behavioral issues. Familiarity with common household hazards can go a long way in keeping cats safe. Statistically, indoor cats live longer than outdoor cats and tend to have less medical expenses. Some cats would enjoy having safe access to the outdoors, either on a leash and harness, with supervision, or in an enclosed area - however, many cats can live happily and successfully as indoor only pets.

    "description": "Come visit me and my Misfits siblings at the Motley Zoo Cat Lounge! \n\n NAME: Marky Ramone\n AGE/GENDER: Baby (born 9/6/2015), Male\n BREED/HAIR LENGTH: Domestic Short Hair \n WEIGHT: ~ 2 lbs \n LITTER BOX TRAINING: Good\n OTHER CATS: Great\n DOGS: Should be fine with proper introduction/socialization \n CHILDREN: Cat respectful children, 8 and older.\n ADOPTION DONATION: $150 alone or $275 total if adopted with another kitten - like one of my Misfits siblings. \n HEALTH: Marky is healthy! He is neutered, microchipped, flea treated, dewormed, and is current on vaccines. Your adoption donation goes toward the cost of this vet care as well as transportation and general care costs. In addition, all pets adopted from Motley Zoo come with 30 days of free pet insurance provided by Shelter Care.\n \n HISTORY: Motley Zoo Animal Rescue was asked to find the Misfits kittens a great forever family and that is exactly what we plan to do!\n \n \n Welcome to Motley Zoo Animal Rescue. We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit animal rescue organization that is run entirely by volunteers. Motley Zoo does not have a brick and mortar shelter location. Instead, all our rescue animals are cared for in private foster homes where the animals receive one-on-one care and attention in a home environment until permanent placement is found. Please email adopt@motleyzoo.org and request an adoption application and we will work toward approving you as an adopter with our rescue so that we can set a time for you to meet! For more information, please visit www.motleyzoo.org.\n\n Thank you for considering adopting a cat in need!\n\n Meow,\n\n The Motley Zoo Crew",

He almost scratched my doorknob off in my bathroom and was meowing so loud at night that I would bring him into my bedroom at night. I would wake up to him curled up on my bed and each day he got closer and now snuggles right beside me. He is extremely curious and loves to watch/follow my other cat and really loves chasing toys around (preferably balls that roll and jingle). His purr is one of the loudest I've heard and you don't have to be petting him to hear it. He starts to purr as soon as he is in the presence of people/kitties. He also loves food and comes running each time I feed him, and loves dried salmon treats. He should be adopted with his sister, Toffee.We are open for adoptions Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday from 12-7. \nIf the cat in in a foster home, we are happy to arrange an appointment.

They are always exploring, playing, cuddling, and practically purr just thinking someone might come into the room.  Their mother was seen jumping out of a trailer that was being moved from one junk yard to another.  At the new location, two tiny kittens were found hiding under the trash.  These girls were instantly happy with whatever life had given them despite the sad beginnings.  Now they are looking and waiting for a great home to appreciate all the love they have to give!  Micah and Kelby are not Cat Tales cats but are being posted as a courtesy for another rescuer. \nIf you would like to meet Micah and Kelby please email fortheloveofcush@gmail.com.\nUpdate from their foster mom, straight from the girls' mouths....\n\nHi! How are you doing?! We know it's not really the right forum in which to ask, but we're just such polite girls that we couldn't resist, and we absolutely love making new friends! You should also probably know that we'v  been told that we're the best kind of friends to have because we can make anyone smile (no matter what kind of day they've had) with our infectiously happy and enthusiastic personalities and affinities for snuggles.  We can liven up even the most boring tasks with our always interested presence and selfless offers of assistance, and we pretty much radiate sunshine with our gentle but loud purrs, prances with tails raised, and soft head bonks. So, if you're looking for two new best friends who were born with the ability to make every one of your days better just by being ourselves, our foster family is pretty sure the slogan \"who rescued who?\" was written with us in mind!  Please email fortheloveofcush@gmail.com to find out more about us!\n\nP.S. We're about 7-months-old, spayed, vaccinated, FIV/FeLV tested, microchipped, and litterbox trained!",

Jimmie and his litter mates were about 5 weeks old and were all brought inside, where Angel raised them. Jimmie is one of 5 kittens and really loves his litter mates. Jimmie would do best if adopted into the same home with one of his litter mates to play with. Kittens do best if they have a buddy to play with. Jimmie gets along well with everyone, but will be shy of new surroundings at first. He requires a family that will give him lots of attention and time to adjust. When adopting a kitten, the human family needs to understand that kittens are active and get into mischief, plus they do require lots of time, attention and patience. It's also necessary to understand that kittens will need the time to adjust to the new situation. Jimmie is a cute boy, with glossy black fur, with a touch of white and big round eyes. Adopting an animal is a lifetime commitment, so please do not adopt until you can make that commitment. Jimmie is neutered, vaccinated, flea treated and wormed.

Kittens do best if they have a buddy to play and snuggle with - especially when the adopter is away at work. Marnie is a young playful kitten, who may be a bit shy of new situations and as is typical of most kittens, should be given time to adjust to a new situation. If you adopt Marnie and hopefully a litter mate or another kitten, they will need time to adjust to the new situation. Then be prepared for lots of fun, affection and action! Marnie loves cat toys & canned food! If you adopt her, you will be very fortunate.

All the kittens were under weight, but once good care was provided, Andy and Opie and their litter mates doubled their weight within 2 weeks!  We placed the whole family in a great foster home, where they all received good food and care. Andy gets along fine with the other cats and kittens, but he loves his brother, Opie. We want them to be adopted into the same home together. They will be a real joy to have in your home - loving, sweet and entertain each other when you're busy or away! It's so rewarding to be able to help this whole family survive and do so well! Andy and Opie really appreciate good food and attention. They need and deserve to be pampered and spoiled. Andy is a handsome boy, with brown tabby fur and green eyes. Adopting an animal is a lifetime commitment, so please do not adopt until you can make that commitment. Andy is neutered, vaccinated, flea treated and wormed. If you are interested in adopting both Andy and Opie, please fill out and submit our on-line application, which is on our website at www.oasisforanimals.org or let us know if you have any questions. We are located on the south end of Whidbey Island, about 15 minutes from the ferry landing in Clinton. We normally take cats to various locations on the mainland on the weekends for adoption, so please just ask or check our Facebook page. Thank you for adopting homeless, rescued kitties!",

Mick was born under a bush and Oasis was called by the homeowner who found them. We went over and picked up Katie and her sweet tiny babies and brought them all to a wonderful foster home. Mick and his litter mates were given the best of care and are now ready for loving homes. Oasis provided Mick with good food and the care the whole family needed. Mick is a sweet boy, who would do best if he was adopted into the same home with one of his litter mates, or a home where there is another kitten for him to play with. The family will need to give him the love and attention he needs. Kittens do best if they have a buddy to play and snuggle with - especially when the adopter is away at work. Mick is a young kitten, who is playful, and as is typical of most kittens, will need time to adjust to a new situation. Mick loves his food, both canned and dry food! If you adopt him, you will be very fortunate. It's necessary for adopters to understand that kittens will need some time to adjust and learn about their new family. Mick is a cute guy, with fluffy black fur and gold/green eyes. Adopting an animal is a lifetime commitment, so please do not adopt until you can make that commitment.

He will allow special people that he considers friends to hold and pet him and rewards them with a nice purr. He seems to like the other kittens and adult cats at the cat center so would probably enjoy having a feline friend.

    "description": "Many questions can be answered by reading through the text below. Kindly read the information before contacting us. Please note: The picture above is a stock photo.\nThank you for your interest in foster kittens! \nKittens who are in our foster care program are generally kittens who arrived at the humane society as unweaned orphans , were still nursing, or were not old or big enough to be placed up for adoption. These kittens would not have survived in a stressful shelter environment. Our foster care program provides care and comfort for animals with special needs in private homes of our trained volunteer foster care providers. \nOnce the kittens are old enough (usually 6-8 weeks) and weigh enough to be spayed or neutered (2 lbs), they return to the shelter for adoption. Call the shelter at (360) 733-2080 to inquire about available kittens. \nPlease note that we do not place âholdsâ on animals until youâve met them in person, even if youâve filled out an application and expressed interest in a specific animal. This is because we want to ensure that each animal is a good fit for the interested party, and that the interested party is a good fit for the animal. We try to set each adoption up for success, for both the animals and for the people.  \nThe kittens would love to meet you! Do you feel the same? Please fill out an adoption application (here or at either shelter) and turn it in to Emily Wyss the foster care coordinator via email at foster@whatcomhumane.org, or fax it to 360.733.4746. Our adoption counselors will help you figure out if you're right for each other.\n\nQuestions about foster kittens in general or other foster animals? Contact Alicia, Foster Care Coordinator, via  email at foster@whatcomhumane.org,or call 360.733.2080 x 3009. Many questions can be answered by reading through the above text.

    "description": "Stevie is a lovely male kitten who is blind. We are guessing his birthdate is in the first week of August 2015. He was born into a feral colony on a farm, and was one of a litter of five, all of his siblings being orange tabbies. Stevie is a long-haired cat, and although his coat started as solid black, it has been developing a very distinctive black smoke colour. Stevie has been neutered and vaccinated.\n\nStevie had his eyes removed when he was nearly three months old as a result of a combination of glaucoma and infection. Other than the eyes, he has been very healthy. His personality is amazing. He is both fun and funny, and outgoing. Although he had to be in screaming pain for most of his life, he never stopped purring and playing. After his eye surgery, he came out of the anaesthetic and immediately started to play with the vet techs. \n\nStevie loves to explore on his own and does not need anyone to move him to a new space - he can find his way just fine. He jumps and plays just like a cat who can see. Until he knows the distance, he backs down off the couch or chair, but when he figures out the distance he will just jump. A paper bag is a great adventure for him (see video), and he loves to play with his ball as well. Stevieâs littermate, who is also up for adoption, is a good buddy to him, if anyone would be interested in the pair together.\n\nStevie will be able to lead an almost completely normal life, but he will need to be strictly indoor-only. He will need a fairly static environment - a home without clutter and that has furniture and things that are not moved around a lot. He will learn every inch of his new home and then will never bump into anything -- if nothing moves. He gets along well with the other kittens, cats, and dogs in his foster home. It would be nice if he could have an animal friend to enrich his life in his adoptive home, but we don't want his adoptive home to have very playful dogs or aggressive cats because of Stevie's obvious disadvantage. A suitable adoptive home will not have family members younger than teenagers. \n\nIt would be best if he could go to someone with experience with blind cats, but a motivated person could certainly learn how to care for him. His adoption will be subject to a $225 fee and a home visit. Please contact us at mbruce8@shaw.ca if you are interested in Stevie and tell us about yourself and the life you envision for him. \n\nYou can view a video of Stevie at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx3fubTdr2Q",

    "description": "*** Please note that the kittens in the photos are from previous years.  Please contact us to find out if we currently have any kittens available.  ***\n\nWhen we have kittens, our kittens don't live at the shelter. They're in foster homes and will be ready for adoption once they're weaned.  If you are interested, please complete the standard pre-adopt form on our web site. We can arrange for you to meet the babies so you can pick out your new family member.\n\nThe kittens will need to go to homes where they will have a cat friend to keep them company, to play with them and snooze with them while you're busy. It doesn't necessarily have to be another kitten (though that's ideal), as long as they will have a young feline friend. These are social critters who rely on games with feline pals to learn life skills. Those who grow up without feline company tend to lose the ability to relate to other cats and have a harder time adjusting to the presence of other cats later in life. They can also become overly dependent on you. We also ask that our kittens go to indoor homes for safety from traffic, predators, disease, poisons, and other dangers in the outside world.\n\nHaving a kitten is like having a toddler in the house. They'll get into everything and they can keep you up at night by scampering around or pouncing your moving toes under the blankets. You'll need patience and you'll need to kitten-proof your house. Cover the soil of your potted plants, hide delicate ornaments and jewelry, tie back your sheer drapes, keep the toilet lid down and check the washer and dryer before you turn them on. After a year or so, your rambunctious little monster will settle down and become a dignified, inscrutable feline who is content to spend long periods meditating and napping. He or she will need you for the next 15 to 20 years of a cat's life span. So consider where you might be 15 or 20 years from now and be sure your cat can still be with you. If you're ready to take on a furry baby, please contact us!",

Baby Beans doesnât careâ¦ he frolics and plays like any other kitten. However, his case is extreme and he is also bowel and bladder incontinent.\n\nThis incontinence caused his people to bring him to be euthanized. The vet just could not euthanize a roly, poly, playful, purring baby (we are so very fortunate to work with so many kind, compassionate vets) so they asked us if we could help. Incontinent animals are a challenge from a practical perspective, and Beans will also need to be closely monitored as he will be susceptible to infections.\n\nWe donât know how long he will be with us, but he is here now. He is joyful and he is greatly loved.",

Of course he does, heâs really just a kitten. \n\nMr. Green has an old eye injury but it does not seem to affect him at all.  The white on the eye is the scar from the injury.  Mr. Green came to us from another shelter and we donât have too much information on his past.  However we have been informed that he loves other felines and canines.  We figure Mr. Green will do best in a home where he has feline and/or canine companions to play with. \n\nMr. Green is a sweet kid who like attention and snuggles.  He will be a perfect addition to any family.  Not much seems to phase Mr. Green and he adjusted to the shelter very quickly. \n\nWe are sure who ever adopts Mr. Green will be one lucky family :D",

Even if I accidentally leave their treats out (which they love), they will be exactly where I left them, untouched.\n\nThese gorgeous girls LOVE to PLAY, and I have found it is the best way to engage and bond with them. They play on their own a bit too but especially like when I play with them.

It is very important that these two girls go to a home where someone will play with them every day. \n\nShay is starting to come around more, and clearly likes to be 'near the action' as long as it doesn't get to close. When she is in the mood-you'll be able to tell when she is very relaxed- she will let you scratch her under her chin and behind the ears and she obviously enjoys it, but can only handle so much. Once in a while she also lets you hold her.

We were too small for adoption so we went into foster care where we have been raised. I am a very adventurous girl and I love to explore. I am very playful so I love toys. I love chasing the toy balls and jumping for the wand toy. I am very playful so I would be best with older children. I do well with other cats and dogs.

If you'd like more information on Samurai and/or Noelia, please email their foster parent Sue Tabor at susantabor@sbcglobal.net or call/text (916) 213-7536.\n\nNoelia is a sweet little orange and white domestic medium hair kitten who was born approximately 8/25/14.    She appeared in a feral colony when she was quite tiny, and was on her own for a short while before she was noticed by the caregivers. She has always been tame, but is shy.  Noelia still needs to be reassured that she is safe and loved. She does like to be held, petted, and scratched around her ears.  She also plays lively games with her other kitten fosters.  Noelia's great love, though, is her big buddy Samurai. Samurai has become her big brother and protector, in a world she is still learning is safe and predictable.  It would be ideal for both Noelia and Samurai if they could be adopted by the same family.\n\nNoelia tested negative for leukemia, is current on her vaccinations, is microchipped, flea treated, and wormed. \n\nSamurai is a beautiful white domestic short hair male with yellow-green eyes, born approximately 8/27/12.  He is an extremely friendly and affectionate cat.  In his post as patriarch of the foster kittens, he has shown patience and dedication as he monitors and plays with those younger than himself.  He has taken a special fancy to Noelia, a little orange kitten in his charge.  This is fortunate for Noelia, because she is shy, and gets the love and reassurance she needs from her big buddy Samurai.  \n\nSamurai knows he has a gift for being in charge.  He makes other adult cats aware of his status in a more or less polite way.  For this reason, Samurai would probably do best in a home with one other cat who  \"sees reason\" (is not dominant).  His ideal home would be one where he and Noelia were the only kitties.\n\nSamurai is tested negative for leukemia and FIV and microchipped.  He is current on his vaccinations, flea treated, and neutered.",

I know to sit at my bowl when I hear the word \"food\" and \"ghaza\". I know to run to the closet when I hear \"Baazi\" (play time in Farsi), because that's where human hides the kitty wand. And I know to line up on the stairs with my other kitty friends when I hear \"1,2,3\" because that's the time to play fetch. I purr when you pet me and meow when I want more food....Long story short, I'm the PUUUURFECT kitty! I will be yours ONLY IF you promise that you will feed me, love me and play with me AND decide that you will keep me forever...and I mean until the very last day of my life.  \n\nCheers, \n Stella aka Paria (Angel Face)",

We cleaned her up and placed her in foster care. She is healthy now and will soon be vaccinated, neutered, tested for FeLV/FIV, microchipped, etc. \n\n Simba has a VERY playful and feisty personality. She is not loud. She carries around toys in her mouth. She loves to chase her wand toy. She allows us to pet her and carry her around, but she prefers to explore her surroundings over sitting still on laps and purring. Simba has no problems with other cats and dogs, though she prefers cats over dogs. She is a survivor and a lover girl indeed!\n\n To ADOPT, please e-mail us at info@TFPF.org!",

    "description": "Scruffy (darker one) is always thinking. He's looking around, planning things out and protective of his \"sister\". He's very playful and loves to attack long strings and carry sparkly balls around in his mouth. He's got a sweet and unique overbite. Very cute!! He let's his sister sit on his head, what a goofball.\n\n\nPretty Baby (lighter one) seems shy at first, but she is very curious and explores and plays like the rest. She loves a soft head pet and likes to meow softly and in a melodic way to communicate. She's beautiful.\n\nPlease let us know if you are interested by emailing us at madisonbott@hotmail.com.\n\nThey are beautiful. We are guessing they are between 2-3 months old. One has more scruffy hair so we call \"him\" Scruffy. The other we think is a girl and we call her Pretty Baby. They are very scared at the moment as they haven't been in a home before and handled this much. They have been eating, drinking, playing and using the litter box we set up for them. We are very hopeful for their future as they have made a lot of social progress in less than 24 hours. They allow us to pet their sweet little heads and back. They do not like it when we grab them to crate them, but it makes sense that that is pretty scary for them right now. They startle easily but with a couple days of support they will acclimate just fine. We need to find them homes right away. We have two older cats who are indoor only and they are stressing about these little newcomers. We really do not want to take them to a shelter.",

He can also be a trouble-maker (just like any kitten, we think!) and likes getting into anything and everything. He's just so goofy and curious that we find him irresistible! We think you will too! Ryker is totally healthy, up-to-date on shots, and ready to go to his new home. We know he will give some lucky person lots of love and laughter! If you would like to meet Ryker, please go to our Karma Rescue APPLICATION page. Please be as thorough as possible when completing it. Thank you! November 18, 2015, 8:33 pm",

The South LA shelter was getting lots of moms + babies, and we stepped in to take these. Albert's sister was adopted and now he is waiting for a home of his own. Albert is about six months old (10/1/15) and ready to bring joy to some special family's life. Albert is so unique looking! He is mostly black, but has grey tufts at his ears, his chest, and legs. And he has the face of an EWOK! So. Darn. Cute. Albert also happens to be totally sweet! He loves to cuddle between his foster parents at night, and when he's sleepy he likes a nice tummy rub. We call him our 'chill kitty' because he's up for anything and nothing fazes him! Of course Albert can play hard too! He likes his fuzzy mice toys and his foil balls and he loves to stealth attack his foster sister (Carli, also for adoption) for some KITTY WRESTLING! He's also a big fan of feeding time and will let you know when it's time for dinner! Albert is a silly kitten, constantly making us laugh, so we know he'll bring laughter wherever he goes. Albert is great with other felines (and with humans) and because he is so young, he must go to a home with another kitty to continue his socialization and to keep him company. Or, maybe you would like to adopt Albert and his mom Addison together?? Consider Albert as the next member of your family! He is healthy, loving, litter-box trained, up-to-date on shots and ready for the next chapter of his little fuzzy life.

She is almost six months old (as of 10-15-15) and fixed, chipped, and up-to-date on shots. She is healthy, litter-trained, and ready for a very special forever home that will give her the attention she craves. Carli looks so unique! She has black and white tuxedo markings, but also some grey tabby stripes mixed in for good measure. We can't take our eyes off her--she's utterly original, and she has the personality to match! Carli is outgoing, with a feisty personality that makes her ready to romp and play at the drop of a hat. But she is also dedicated to cuddling with her humans, sleeping with her foster folks every single night--tucked into the side of one of them--and purring happily. Carli has a motor that will rival any sports car, we swear! Because she is so social, we'd love to see Carli in a home with another kitty or with a human who is around A LOT.

    "description": "Spice was found in a bag inside a dumpster in an alley behind his foster momâs work, along with three other kitties. She gently gathered them up into her arms to save them, and then called us for help.\n \nSpice loves people and he will follow you everywhere. He plays fetch and loves to play tag. He is very rambunctious and plays continuously until he suddenly drops and falls sleep. He is a super snuggler. At night he will curl up under your chin, and will wake you up by giving your face a nice grooming. He has a super enthusiastic purr when he greets you at the door. He loves to be carried and combed.\n \nSpice is a true Miracle Kitty! When Spice was a baby he started having problems swallowing, and his foster mom rushed him to the vet. He was diagnosed with a mega-esophagus which means that the tube that goes from his mouth to his stomach grew too fast when he was a baby. Recent x-rays show that it has stopped growing which should provide him relief as he gets bigger. The vet confirmed that they do not think the esophagus has continued to expand, and with his growth, that is excellent news! He eats standing up so that gravity can help his food go down. He has a custom made Lego table made for him so that as he grows more Legos can be added and so it grows with him. He also requires oral medication twice a day that helps pass the food into his stomach. He will need special care for the remainder of his precious life. He needs to be on a fish-free diet with water added to his food. Despite these challenges, Spice is an easy kitty to take care of. His foster mom says that he is doing great and he is very rambunctious!\n \nSpice would do best in a home where there is someone around with him. He cries when he is left alone. He would prefer a home without no other cat or dog so that he does not have access to their food as he will try to eat it and he could aspirate (get food in his lungs), catch pneumonia and suffer.\n \nSpice is about 14 weeks old. He has been vaccinated and will be fixed and micro-chipped. He is looking a very special forever home.  Please open up your heart and your home for this special little guy!\n \nIf you want to talk to his foster mom about adopting Spice, would like to meet him, or have questions, please call Cindy at (310) 927-1999.",

In fact, his mission in life is to play, play, play!  And while he comes from a litter of 7, his twin brother Logan, is his best buddy. His foster mom refers to them collectively, as the Berry brothers!  Huckle, and Logan, are sweet and active, and true boyâs boys. They entertain their foster mom with their antics!  Playing is seriously job one for these brothers!  Unless it is nap and cuddle time. Even then, it is more fun to lie on their foster momâs feet to napâ¦in case a toe moves to pounce!  Feather sticks, balls, fake mice, paperâ¦they are up for any toy you provide. They are truly grateful to be free of the shelter cage and able to run and play as is evident in their happy-go-lucky attitudes. Huckle will bring a delightful joy to your life with his spirited personality.  Heâd really love to go to his forever home with his twin brother Logan, so why not double your fun and take home both!?!",

They made it through, and they are now immune.  She is healthy, sassy and she's a talker! This girl has so much personality!  She is about 15 weeks old and current on vaccines, tested negative for feline leukemia and FIV.   Uses the litter box like a champ, loves food, and has a toy monkey that she doesn't ever part with.

Her kitten purr melts the hearts the iciest people on the planet, and she loves kisses all over her head and face and will happily return them!! This little girl is truly a rare gem, and anyone lucky enough to adopt her will be wondering how they survived before she joined their lives.  She is shockingly confident and outgoing, especially for such a little youngster.  Did we mention that anytime she hears a tissue being wadded up she comes running, hoping for a game of fetch?  Or that bed-making is the most exciting sport imaginable??  She loves her foster brothers Charlie and Bravo, if you are interested in adopting more than one cat, and if you want to fill your life with more joy than you thought was humanly possible!!!",

Tiki was rescued from the shelter at a mere 4 weeks old when she was abandoned after having been attacked by a dog. Her front paw was crushed in the process. We have since taken her for orthopedic visits and at this point Tiki does not need any corrective surgery! She uses her leg just fine, her paw is just a little different looking. But that doesn't stop her from doing ANYTHING regularly mobile cats do. You wouldn't even know she had been through that. Tiki is very playful and needs another cat or dog to play and cuddle with. She is also extremely smart. Because of her minor disability, she will have to be an indoor only cat. Please email us if interested in meeting her! adopt@armeteam.org",

They handled and loved us while she was off doing whatever it is stray cats do when you canât see them.  Well, we DO know one thing she did, and there we wereâ¦\n\nWhen we were weaned, the family called PZF to see if we could come to them to be fixed and placed in new loving homes, but indoors and safe as family members forever.  They were going to catch Mom and get her fixed with the help of PZF so we are the end of the family line, so to speak.\n\nI am a little shy but if you tempt me with toys that have strings, I am all over that! Otherwise, I love to spend time playing with my siblings.\n\nAll of us are really well adjusted.  We play hard and sleep hard all together.  We run to people to be held and played with, use the litter box really consistently (and a lot, as kittens do).  We are not picky eaters, and give really funny little kitty kisses most of the time â we have a hard time concentrating and holding still at this age.\n\nAt our tender age, we will need to go home with one of our siblings or another young kitten pal if there are no other pets in the home to play with.  If you are ready for a lot of kitten action, funny antics, and have a lot of time and love to give, wait no longer!  We are chomping at the bit to get to our real, forever homes and meet the people we were destined to share life with. \n\nYoo hoo!  Over here!",

We have since taken her for orthopedic visits and at this point Tiki does not need any corrective surgery! She uses her leg just fine, her paw is just a little different looking. But that doesn't stop her from doing ANYTHING regularly mobile cats do. You wouldn't even know she had been through that. Tiki is very playful and needs another cat or dog to play and cuddle with. She is also extremely smart. Because of her minor disability, she will have to be an indoor only cat. Please email us if interested in meeting her! adopt@armeteam.org",

    "description": "DOB: 8/10/15 -  Hi! My name is Bear! I got my name from being the cuddly teddy bear that I am. There's nothing I love more than spending time with you. I'm an easy going kind of guy, but I also love to play. I get these energy bursts and run all around and do funny leaps in the air with my toys, then when I'm done I like to sprawl out on the ground and lie flat with my back legs sticking straight out in back like a little frog. I just love my cuddle time, and will purr loudly when you pet me. When I would like you to cuddle me, I do a very small, short, broken up, meow to get your attention. My foster parents say I sound like a little lamb because of my unique meow. I'm told I make a tiny snore noise when I'm sleeping or getting loving, and when I get an idea either to do something fun or to come get cuddles, I make a small \"ooh, ooh\" sound that my foster family says sounds like a baby monkey! I guess I'm a mixture of all sorts of animals! I'm cuddly like a bear, I lay like a frog, I meow like a lamb, and I make happy noises like a baby monkey! I have another talent too! I turn into liquid kitty! I love my time with you so much, that I just melt in your arms. I stare into your eyes and purr while you rub my face and cuddle me. I get so relaxed when you pet me, that I've been known to roll right off your lap, chest, bed, or desk and fall on the floor if you don't catch me! Thankfully, I always land on my feet! I guess you could say I literally \"fall for you\". I love to nap on you while you watch a movie, and make a great lounge buddy. My foster family describe me as a sweet puddle of love, and tell me there's someone special out there waiting with open arms that I can melt right into. Is that special someone you? \n\nFully vetted including double FVRCP vaccinations, tested for FeLV/FIV (Aids and Leukemia), flea treatment and spayed or neutered.

    "description": "This is Magic, an adorable 1/2 Siamese black kitten, with a sibling named Ashton.  Magic came with five siblings, at a very young age, along with their beautiful chocolate point mother, who was mostly feral.  The kittens were weaned and then fostered in a home of their own to be fully socialized and reach the age where they could go out on their own.\n  The foster did a terrific job, and these kittens are beautiful, healthy, muscular, outgoing, and fun!  Magic does her best to convince potential adopters that she should be the one to get adopted. She will follow her humans around, participate in all of their activities, and then crash in their lap to generate energy for when she wakes up.\n  Magic will need another cat buddy, and cannot be an only child.  An adoption donation of $95.00 applies to her adoption, but if you want to adopt two kittens, a \"special\" can be offered.\n\nNOTE:  Spunky's is a charitable organization and 100% of all donations and\nadoption fees go back into the saving and caring for these animals.\n        Our animals come from a variety of situations, and some come in off the street, in poor health, or very sick.  Others might have emotional issues or permanent physical issues caused by abuse.  They get the necessary veterinary care and lots of loving to make them ready to go to their \"forever\" home. \n     Please understand that some of our cats may still be in their \"before\" stage, whether its convalescing from illness or injury, learning to trust, or something as simple as beginning to thrive on regular meals and good nutrition.\n     We do not participate in any breeding or sales.  All cats are or will be altered prior to adoption.\n     Our adoption agreement allows for the return of any adopted animal at any time for any reason, and requires an animal to be returned if the adopter's circumstances should change and the animal can no longer be kept.",

    "description": "DOB: 5/14/15 Lucretiaâs golden eyes are beautiful, but also expressive, like she is. When Lulu was a tiny infant kitten and her foster mama would move her and her siblings out of their playpen into a kitty carrier when it was playpen-cleaning time, Lucretia, like her siblings, would sometimes mew plaintively when she was picked up off the playpen floor and then put in the carrier. However, she didnât stop mewing when she was safely back on the ground inside the carrier, she kept mewing until all of her siblings were also safely in there with her. She always wanted to make sure all her siblings were safe and that she could see them, which was pretty extraordinary behavior for a four week-old kitten. Sheâs grown into a lovely little girl, who loves to play with toys and with her siblings and other playmates in the house. Sheâs full of energy, but also sweet-natured and snuggly, and loves to be pet and loved on by people. Sheâs pretty perfect :) Luretia is very social, so she needs to be adopted either along with another kitten (ideally a sibling, although that is certainly not a requirement) or to a home where there is already another animal (kitten, adult cat, or cat-loving puppy or adult dog) that would be her full-time playmate.

    "description": "DOB: 5/14/15 This is Maximus, who was named ironically due to the fact that he was the runt of his litter. He wasnât just a little smaller, he was about half the size of his largest brother. So, he was given the name Maximus as an aspirational title, so that he would grow big and strong. And, fortunately, Maximus has grown to be a beautiful, strong boy with tons of personality. Even though he has a sister that looks very much like him, and there are some playmates in the house that also strongly resemble him, it isnât hard to pick out Maximus in the room â heâs usually the first one to talk. Being tiny, he learned that if he needed something, he had to speak up! So he doesnât hesitate to tell his foster mom when he needs a little extra food or wants her to help him out of a situation he may have entangled himself in. He loves toys, especially things on strings, and heâll fly through the air to grab them. He is also very affectionate and is a total purr monster. Although this is a family trait, all of his siblings also have purrs that sound like little motors. Maximus is an extremely social little boy, so he needs to be adopted either along with another kitten (ideally a sibling, although that is certainly not a requirement) or to a home where there is already another animal (kitten, adult cat, or cat-loving puppy or adult dog) that would be his full-time playmate.

He has continued to remain so, and is larger than both his blood-related siblings, and also most of the other litter of slightly older kittens that he grew up with in his foster home. Valerius is a big, strong, lovable, low-maintenance, silent-type. He is just kind of perfect, really. Heâs handsome, playful, mellow, and just a naturally happy and contented little boy. He loves to play, and plays with any other kitten who is up for a game. His easy-going nature means heâs also buddies with anyone who wants to be buddies â heâll snuggle up with anyone in the household who wants a snuggle buddy. Heâs very playful, but in his heart of hearts, heâs a lover, not a fighter â the gentle giant. (Heâs still a little boy, just big compared to his siblings.)

    "description": "DOB: 5/14/15 This little one is the Miss Congeniality of our household, which is incredible considering that at 4 weeks old, she was one of the most fearful, hostile, and wild little feral kittens her foster parents have ever encountered! They were worried about whether this one would tame, but fortunately little Tullia has turned out to be a first class love-bug with an amazing personality. She is one of those that would be described as very conscious, very present, and totally engaged with her humans. She loves to make eye contact with you, really wants to communicate, and will usually begin to peep out little greetings when she does. She also does fabulous âfloompsâ â sheâll just drop from a standing position to a lying-down position very dramatically, in a way that should have a sound effect â and we imagine âfloompâ would be the sound. Usually when she does this floomping, if youâre not close enough to reach out and pet her, sheâll then slither toward you on her side, purring and purring, until she can get right up to within armâs reach, so that you can pet her while she makes âair biscuitsâ with her paws. She is big on the kneading dough thing, and loves, loves, loves soft blankies and kitty beds. She also seems to have a sense of gentleness and empathy when itâs called for. One of the other kitties in her foster home is an elderly 16 year-old boy who has a lot of health challenges and has been feeling kind of poorly. He loves kittens, but not to play with, just bathing and snuggling, thank-you-very-much. Unlike some of the other youngsters in the household, Tullia seems to sense this, and is very gentle to this sweet old guy, and snuggles up next to him without annoying him. She even will try to give him little baths sometimes, and he returns the favor to her. Tullia is very social, so she needs to be adopted either along with another kitten (ideally a sibling, although that is certainly not a requirement) or to a home where there is already another animal (kitten, adult cat, or cat-loving puppy or adult dog) that would be her full-time playmate.

She is so gentle and sweet that you could almost say that she has a slight shy streak, but her naturally sweet disposition and very playful nature make that shyness easy to overcome â a toy will do it every time. She loves to play with the other kittens in the household, and she also loves to curl up and snuggle with them when playtime is over. That is true with people as well, she loves to stretch out on the bed and rumble away at the end of a long play session. Sheâs naturally curious, but unlike some of her playmates, ahem, she is not destructive in her curiosity â she has what almost seems to be a natural courteousness when it comes to exploring a space, which is really, really refreshing when dealing with a houseful of little ones who are constantly knocking stuff over, pulling things out of boxes, and dragging things around a room. That doesnât mean that she doesnât know how to play hard or do normal kitten things â sheâs just got a little more grace than most.

    "description": "DOB: 8/14/15 Hi! My name is Cuatro-Gato. I'm a little lynx point Siamese boy. I was born on August 14, 2015. My three littermates and I were only hours old when a Good Samaritan heard us crying as she left her evening church service. Following the sound of our frantic cries, she discovered us in a dirty old cardboard box that had been taped shut, trapping us inside. She took us home for the night and did her best to keep us warm. Not knowing how to properly care for such young kittens, she took us to Pasadena Petco the following morning. As luck would have it Kitten Rescue volunteers were holding their weekly adoption event and we were handed over to someone well versed in the care of neonatal kittens. Soon we were swaddled in a heated blanket and being bottle fed delicious and nutritious fresh goat milk formula. In our foster home weâve been raised with other kitties of all ages, dogs, and a young child too! Having been bottle fed and hand raised, weâre all super used to being held and cuddled. Weâre incredibly affectionate and love to play and interact with people and other critters alike. Weâre now ready for homes and families of our own. We definitely MUST either go to a home that already has another playful kitty to romp and frolic with or we must be adopted in pairs. We would not do well as single kittens, as we would greatly miss the kitty companionship and interaction weâre used to. I would LOVE for you to consider adopting me along with one (or more!) of my siblings Uno-Gato, Dos-Gato and Tres-Gato.

I have two sisters, so needless to say, Iâm easy going. My foster Mom calls me Little Man because she thinks I have the eyes of a genius deep in thought. I like to watch and analyze what is going on around me before I get involved. Once I know it is worthy of my time I jump right in. I put up with the big dog I live with, but I love all the other felines. I am always with a fur pal, whether I am sleeping, eating or playing. I kinda look like a tough guy, but I am just a bundle of love. I would do better if I had a feline pal at your home to hang with.

On the morning of April 27th in Pomona California our mama (a stray/feral) gave birth to me and my brother âon-the-runâ for some reason, dropping each one of us in a different location in someoneâs yard. She then just disappeared and never came back for us. The lady of the house discovered us and knew instantly that we needed specialized care if we were to have a chance of survival. She contacted Kitten Rescue and a short time later she delivered us to our foster mom. We were INCREDIBLY tiny at only 2 Â½ and 2 Â¾ oz. but we were fighters! My brother Weensy and I were bottle fed and hand-raised, traveling back and forth to work every day with our foster mom so she could feed us around the clock. With good food in our tummies, a warm snuggly bed, and lots of loving care, we began to thrive. Since weâd gotten so much hands-on attention since birth, weâre very people-oriented, loving, and cuddly. My brother has already found his forever home, but Iâm still waiting for my new family to find me! I love to play, and play, and then play some more . . . . and then find an inviting lap to nap in. I get along great with other kitties of all ages, dogs, and kids too. Since Iâm used to having kitty companionship, itâs important that I go to a home that already has another playful kitty or that I be adopted along with a buddy.

She gets along with everyone: cats, kittens, non-aggressive dogs, and small children. She is the first to great you at the door, and given the chance, will lay in your lap or sleep cuddled next to you in bed all night long. Originally rescued from the side of the I5 North in Burbank, watching traffic whizz past, she was kept in a toddlerâs room for her first days in foster care. Her toddler roommate enjoyed hugging her and carrying her around like a doll. None of this bothered Anna who is always positive and looking to connect. As a kitten Anna had an inner ear infection caused by polyps. She had to have surgery to remove the polyps and is now better. However, her ear condition may mean that she will have a balance issue and a slight head tilt going forward. Although extremely active and playful, Anna will never be as safe as other cats climbing high up. When being put down on the ground, she sometimes thinks she is falling and will try to flip over and land on her back instead of her feet. Anna is a world-class food snatcher, sometimes door dasher, and finger/ ear-lobe nurser. Her adopters would need to be patient and understanding with these behaviors. That probably translates to mean that they would have previous experience with cats. An extremely entertaining character, Anna is looking for a home where she could have another animal buddy and lots of humans to love.

    "description": "DOB: 4/10/15 Ladybug here! Iâm a sweet and spunky little brown tabby girl with a heart of gold. Hereâs the story of how I came to be searching for a family to love and cherish me: My sister Snugglebug and I were found abandoned and taken to the East Valley Animal Control facility in mid-April when we were only a day or two old. Kitten Rescue was contacted and our foster mom dropped everything to come rescue us. You see, neonate kittens must be accepted by a recognized rescue organization immediately or theyâre euthanized before the end of the day. Heartbreaking . . . . but true. We were bottle fed and hand-raised, traveling back and forth to work every day for five weeks so our foster mom could feed us around the clock. Since weâve gotten so much hands-on attention since birth, weâre very people-oriented, loving, and cuddly. Weâve both blossomed in foster care! We love to play, and play, and then play some more. Weâve been raised in a home with other kitties (all ages), three kitty-loving dogs, and a 7 year old child whoâs spoiled us rotten since the time we were super tiny. My sister and I are now ready for our own family(s) and forever home(s). While we would love to go to a home together, itâs not a âdeal-breakerâ. If you already have another playful kitty for us to romp and frolic with thatâs fine. However, we would not do well as single kittens as we would greatly miss the kitty companionship and interaction that weâre used to. If you donât already have a kitty companion for us, we must be adopted together.

I love playing with my kitty friends and with my toys. My favorite games are kitty-soccer and trying to catch stringy toys. I was a stray, teeny-tiny kitten all by himself on the streets of Istanbul, Turkey. A nice lady rescued me, brought me to Los Angeles and got me into foster care. I am looking forward to finding my forever home and give you lots of love and happiness.

Unless of course, he is in the midst of a life or death chase with a little piece of crumpled up paperâ¦yes, he is that easily pleased with a simple, small ball of paper and will carry it around until it basically falls apart...at what point you just have to crumple up another post-it note. He does love climbing as well & is a bit of an escape artist. He is such a playful little character! He has been pretty specific when it comes to food, but Iâve discovered what he canât resist, so donât worry. Being bottle-fed since he was two days old, he started out on the smaller side, but has now come into his own with his puffy hair and enormous tail.

They are truly an amazing little pair to watch and it is in both their best interests to stay together in their forever home. She can't say no to anything that dangles and is also a world-class climber so cat trees or condos really are a must-have for her. Claudia is not very vocal, being more of a looker than a talker, but will let out her little squeak to let her brother know exactly when he has played a little too roughly with her...or when she's ready for some more treats.

    "description": "DOB: 8/15/15 Elvis is an incredibly special boy who was found on an I-10 offramp. From the moment he was rescued, malnourished and under 1lb, he has loved his human friends! He is a 'guy's guy' and will run to the door to greet his male human friends when they come home. He loves to find a comfortable place on a person to sleep. When a guy takes off a hat and puts it down Elvis will always jump inside and take a nap. He watches TV with you and will follow the mouse on your computer screen for hours. And he loves other cats! He holds his own with friendly, beta male cats but crushes on girl cats. Boy does he love the girls! He has charisma to spare. He has no destructive behaviors and can easily redirected using wand toys or a laser. He is a sweet, perfect little boy!

Loves to interact through play, especially if he can not get blocked by his brothers from catching the toy. Has a really sweet, slightly grumpy looking face! Miso is gentle and quiet and has made excellent progress coming out of his shell. Would be excellent adopted as a pair with one of his littermates. Loves to snuggle in a pile with them and be groomed by his brothers. Like the other 'Sushi Kittens' he seems to be fond of belly rubs and is very calm being handled (like a the way a ragdoll acts). He has made wonderful strides since he came off the streets of South Gate. Would be good with other kittens, unsure about interactions with dogs (he hasn't met any yet) and possibly with a very gentle older cat who likes to snuggle.

    "description": "DOB: 4/1/15 Unagi was the first of his litter to be trapped and fixed, which is why he has an eartip. He came to us underweight and with a bad cold, from living in an industrial use lot in South Gate. Once we realized how tiny and friendly he was, we knew he had to be fostered. Unagi is spunky, loving and likes to feel that he is in charge. He is an affectionate cat and will snuggle in bed and on the couch. Gets along wonderfully with older cats who are amenable to kittens. Do not recommend as a solo cat. His whole litter (nicknamed the Sushi Kittens) are bonded and adopting a pair of them would make for excellent lifetime companionship for these guys. Unagi rolls over for belly rubs, just like all his siblings. His chirping meow and high flying leaps during feather toy playtime will steal your heart. Playful, active but also gentle and VERY sweet. Walks with the cutest little bow legged strut! We adore him. Siblings names are: Nori, Tako, Tamago, Miso, Toro.

    "description": "DOB: 4/1/15 Tamago is one of the most affectionate, lovebug cats we have ever met. Tamago had it the worst when we trapped him: a very bad upper respiratory infection that made his eyes barely open and his little breath rattle. Even then he was trying to snuggle everyone that came near him and was playful and gentle. He allowed medicine to be administered without so much a whimper. He has recovered fully from his cold (which you can see a bit in one of his photos). Tamago is looking for a good lap to snuggle in, or possibly to just flop on any available inch of you that he can find. Tiny chirping meow and a sweet face with delicate features. Tamago is playful, active, very calm, confident and affectionate. He seems to enjoy watching our older cats through the balcony door, so we think he could get along with most any other cat. Tamago would best be adopted along with a littermate though. He is a wonderful groomer and peace maker of the 'Sushi Kittens' and can not be a solo cat.

    "description": "DOB: 4/1/15 Toro is an inquisitive, loving and athletic cat. He is the biggest of his litter and absolutely loves to play! Whether its a game of chasing the feather on a string toy around or chasing after a toy thrown across the room, Toro is a blast. Toro is quite the snuggler, he loves to hop in your lap and roll over to look at you lovingly while you rub his belly and cheeks. He is very confident and will always be the first off the nap-pile to come run and say hi and ask for attention. When people say 'My cat is more like a dog' this is the kind of cat they're talking about! Would be best adopted with one of his littermates (the Sushi Kittens!) since they are not only bonded but play amazingly together. He has shown no destructive tendencies (shredding, clawing) but with such an active demeanor, a playmate is crucial! Is very interested in the older cats in the house, so would also be good for an adult cat that is active and likes to play. Siblings names are: Nori, Tako, Tamago, Miso, Toro.

I scare easily so am not good with small kids or being put outside. My favorite toy is a mouse in a tunnel which I can't quite get hold of although I try until I am disgusted with the stupid little rat.

We had to rush to get there by 5:00 or they would have been euthanized due to their small size. The shelter does not have staff on hand to bottle feed over night.  Because they were bottle babies - these are very sweet and loving kittens. And adorable too! If you are interested in adopting , please e-mail jcirwin@pacbell.net to request an application or call (818)707-6186. Our adoption fee is $125.00 per cat which covers the cost of spaying or neutering, testing for feline aids and leukemia, first vaccination, de-worming, Advantage flea treatment, and the care of the animal prior to adoption.

All of my kitty family and friends got rescued from the restaurant but nobody knew about me and I almost got left behind!! Luckily, on the very last night before B/G closed, I crept out onto the awning over the main walkway and the valet saw me. He called the rescue folks and they came and got me so now Iâm much happier, and not starving like I was. And I need a permanent, loving home; I am still getting used to being around people and am still scared some of the time. I am also very friendly and I purr a lot when you pet me. I think I get along fine with other cats, I am neutered and have started my vaccinations. Do you think you could adopt me?????\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Beckham, please visit our website, www.catposse.org and fill out the application on his page.

I am not a lap kitty but I will sit on the couch right next to you and watch whatever you watch. I have a big motor and am easily made happy.

With all of us in tow, we when to our new foster home. We met so many new friends and learned to like doggies. \nWe have been in foster care for about 8 months now still looking for our forever family. Well, only my brother Dallas and I are. Our sister Cheyenne was recently adopted to an amazing family who loves her so much! We are so happy for her but are still thinking about the day we get our new family. \n\nI am a very sweet and rambunctious boy who loves to run around and have fun. I love belly rubs and purring for days. I love climbing cat trees, and playing with my foster friends. I am an overall goofy boy who is looking for a home that will fit all my wild antics.  \n\nI am neutered, up to date on all my shots, combo tested (neg/neg) and potty trained. I would do best in a home with another kitty or with a family that is home to play with me. \n\nIf you are interested in me, please fill out an adoption application. I cant wait to meet you!",

She says that I have a Cindy Crawford dot on my cheek. I love playing and being the center of attention. I am also curious and always ready to play with whatever is in your hand. I am fine with other cats and dogs and with kids too. I am ready for my forever home and hope to go with one of my litter mates or to a home with another kitten or cat or dog.

We lived there concealed in the bushes for about 6 weeks but as we got bigger and more adventurous, the woman who owned the home started to worry that we would be grabbed by coyotes. She called SBACC and one of the volunteers helped trap us. It took nearly a week to get all of us. Our Mama was spayed and vaccinated and released but we kittens all went to a foster home where we got lots of TLC. I can be a little shy at first but I warm up quickly and love attention. I enjoy playing and am great with dogs, other cats and kids. I am now ready for my forever home and hope to go with one of my litter mates or to a home with another cat or kitten or dog.

My front right leg had already begun to heal on it's own but with some irreparable damage. I have a permanent limp (my foster mom thinks I look like a bunny when I run across the room) but it does not slow me down, I can get to the top of the cat tower faster than any of my foster kitty siblings! \nAfter a month in the hospital, my foster mom brought me home and I am slowly learning to trust people again. Anytime anyone picked me up at the hospital it was to give me a painful shot or yucky medicine. I learned to associate being touched with getting medicine or a shot. I would growl and hiss anytime my foster mom tried to pet or hug me. With a lot of time and patience she has showed me that not all people are bad. I am still skittish at times, but I have learned that people really do give the best pets. I especially love butt rubs and chin scratches!\nI really love cat towers. I prefer the ones that have the cubbies so I can crawl in there and take a good nap, I feel safe when its enclosed. I enjoy playing with my foster kitty siblings and can keep up with them just fine even with my bum leg.\nI'm looking for someone who can be patient with me. I have the potential to be a snuggle bug if someone is willing to earn my trust. It will be a slow process in the beginning so I need someone who won't give up on me. I live happily with other kitties and dogs. I don't really know how I am with kids since I'm still a little scared of people. I might get along better with older kids who know what it will take to be friends with me. I really just want love, I'm realizing that I can receive a lot of love from people so I hope there is someone out there who will love me.\nIf you are interested in meeting me or have specific questions, please contact Kathy at 714-745-8060 respond to this ad or meet me in person this Saturday at PetCo Buena Park, corner of Valley View and Ball Road.",
