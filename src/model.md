### ReactDatum.Model

This react-datum component provides datums with a Backbone model and rerenders descendants on model changes.  

Any datum component like [ReactDatum.Text](TODO: add a link do doc page), will accept the Backbone model provided by this class as a context variable.  Outside of a **ReactDatum.Model*** component, datums will not respond to model changes.
